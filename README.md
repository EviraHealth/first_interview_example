# Interview example

During the first technical interview you will be expected to write code or pseudocode in a live JS environment. 

In the interview you will solve problems of similar complexity. You will work on three problems, with a time limit on each one. For each problem you solve you will unlock the next.

See `findClosestDivisor.js` for more information how a draft problem might look.
